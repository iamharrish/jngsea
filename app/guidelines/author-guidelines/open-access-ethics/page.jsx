          <p>
            Journal of Next-Gen Science and Engineering Applications (JNGSEA) follows the Open Access publishing model, ensuring that research outputs are freely available to all
            without financial, legal, or technical barriers. In this model, readers and their institutions are not charged for access. Users are permitted to read, download, copy,
            distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, or use them for any lawful non-commercial purpose, without asking prior permission from the publisher
            or the author.
          </p>
          <p>
            The publication cost is typically covered by the author's institution or research funding bodies. These Open Access charges substitute traditional subscription fees and
            ensure the journal content remains freely accessible, especially to researchers, academicians, and young scholars from underrepresented and developing regions.

            JNGSEA is committed to maintaining the highest standards of publication ethics and adheres to the guidelines outlined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). The
